            <h1>What exactly are Git and GitHub?</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Git</strong> is a piece of software that allows you to keep track of changes you and other people make to your files. Most importantly, it allows any number of people work on different parts of a complex project at the same time. New versions of a file can be <em>branched</em> off of a <em>trunk</em>
                , and those branches can later be <em>merged</em> back into the trunk. Any number of people anywhere in the world
                can work on versions of the same file, notifying administrators when they think their code is ready to be
                merged back into the master branch. It&rsquo;s a great way for a group of people to work on a project together.
                Git is primarily used for source code management in software development , but it can be used to keep track
                of changes in any set of files. You can learn more by visiting the Git project&rsquo;s
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">documentation</a> .</p>
            <p>
                <strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based hosting service for version control using git. It is mostly used for source
                code . It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as
                well as adding its own features. It provides access control and collaboration features such as bug tracking
                , feature requests , task management , and wikis for every project.</p>
            <p>You might want to try this short, introductory tutorial on using
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">GitHub from the command line</a> . It should take 15 minute to half an hour to complete.</p>

            <h1>What&rsquo;s the command line?</h1>
            <p>You usually use a mouse or your fingers to click or tap icons on your desktop or elsewhere and access files,
                folders, and programs. But that&rsquo;s just one of the ways you can communicate with your
                computer. The command line or
                <strong>command line interface (CLI)</strong> is a text-based interface that developers use to more effectively and
                efficiently communicate with computers to accomplish a wide set of tasks. Other names for the command line
                are: cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal.</p>
            <p>There are at two command line interfaces built into Windows 10. The first is the older
                <strong>command prompt (CMD)</strong> and the second is the newer and more powerful
                <strong>PowerShell (PSH)</strong>. PSH can used to perform and automate tasks not just in Windows but in other Microsoft
                products as well. Both CMD and PSH use commands that are unique to Windows and that wouldn&rsquo;t work on
                a Unix machine or Mac. This can be problematic, because most developers are accustomed to commands that work
                on both Unix and Mac machines. Don&rsquo;t worry, there are several workarounds.</p>
            <p>The command line can be &ldquo;
                <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&rdquo; Running the command line as an administrator will allow you to do things
                like install and delete programs, things you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do as an ordinary user. As you set
                up your development environment, you will often need to run the command line as an administrator. Pay close
                attention when you&rsquo;re doing this, because, as an administrator, you will be able to do things that
                might damage your files or your Windows installation.
            </p>
            <p>There are several excellent free courses out there on how to use the command line. You might want to try Codecademy&rsquo;s
                free course on
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">using the Unix command line</a> . The course covers a lot of basic commands that are regularly used by developers.
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud595">Udacity</a> ,
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal">Rithm School</a> , and
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-development-basics/a-command-line-crash-course">Viking Code School</a> also offer free courses on how to use the command line.</p>
            <p>Once you&rsquo;re familiar with the command line, you might want to investigate
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a> and
                <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conemu.github.io/">ConEmu</a> , which will improve your command line experience.</p>

            <h1>Why take a course on using the Unix command line, if I have a Windows machine?&nbsp;</h1>
            <p>We mentioned earlier that when you install the GitHub desktop application, Git Bash is also installed. Git Bash
                is another CLI that packages a variety of utilities together. Git Bash understands many Unix commands and
                is the CLI you&rsquo;ll use when performing most git tasks.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Configure Git</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Open PowerShell in admin mode. Now enter the following commands, replacing &ldquo;John Doe&rdquo; and &ldquo; johndoe@example.com
            &rdquo; with the username and email address you used when you created your GitHub account.</p>
        {% highlight ruby %}
        git config --global user.name "John Doe"
        git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>To see all of your settings enter:</p>
        {% highlight ruby %}
        git config --list
        {% endhighlight %}
        <aside>
            <h1>How do I open PowerShell?</h1>
            <p>Three ways to open PowerShell</p>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>In your taskbar&rsquo;s search box, enter PowerShell. Click or tap on the PowerShell result. To launch as
                    administrator, right-click (or tap and hold, if you use a touchscreen) on the PowerShell search result,
                    and then click/tap on &ldquo;Run as administrator.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Press the Win + R keys on your keyboard. Type PowerShell and press Enter or click/tap OK</li>
                <li>Open your taskbar settings and set &ldquo;Replace Command Prompt with PowerShell&hellip;&rdquo; to &ldquo;on.&rdquo;
                    Close settings. Now press the Win + X keys on your keyboard and select &ldquo;Windows PowerShell&rdquo;
                    or &ldquo;Windows PowerShell (Admin).&rdquo;</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 4: Install Chocolatey</h2>
        </header>
        <p>We&rsquo;re going to use the command line to install an application called Chocolatey.</p>
        <aside>
            <h1>Wait a minute! What is Chocolatey?</h1>
            <p>Chocolatey is what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;package manager&rdquo; for Windows. You can think of it as an application
                that assists in installing and updating other applications. We&rsquo;re going to use it to install another
                application called Meteor.js. More on that later.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Cut and paste the following command into the command line:</p>
        {% highlight ruby %}
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
        {% endhighlight %}
        <p>Answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when prompted. When Chocolatey has finished installing, close and then reopen PowerShell
            in admin mode.
        </p>

        <aside>
            <h1>What if I get errors while installing?</h1>
            <p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to encounter errors while installing Chocolatey or other packages. Don&rsquo;t worry
                and don&rsquo;t be discouraged. Expect that you may have to Google various error messages and that this may
                take some time. If Googling doesn&rsquo;t work, or the solution is confusing, reach out to the CodeBuddies
                Slack community.</p>
