<p>I spent the past twelve and a half years at Nonprofit VOTE, a small, Boston-based 501(c)(3) the mission of which is to work with nonprofit service providers and community-based organizations to help the people they serve become more civically engaged. My work comprised conducting research on nonpartisan civic and voter engagement, creating training materials and other resources, and providing training to organizations to enable them to integrate civic engagement activities into their ongoing work. </p>

<p>I was also de facto head of technology and web development at Nonprofit VOTE. My work in that role was to spearhead the expansion of our online presence and oversee development and maintenance of our websites, including NonprofitVOTE.org and NationalVoterRegistrationDay.org.</p>

<p>In January, 2018, I decided to leave Nonprofit VOTE to pursue a new career in web developement. I am currently a student at the Flatiron School and am also a participant in Udacity's Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge.</p>
