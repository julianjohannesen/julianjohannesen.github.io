<p>For the past twelve years I've worked for Nonprofit VOTE, conducting research on nonpartisan
    voter engagement for 501(c)(3) nonprofits service providers and community-based organizations, 
    creating educational materials, and conducting trainings to help service-oriented 501(c)(3)s 
    easily integrate voter-engagement activities into their ongoing work. While at Nonprofit VOTE, 
    I was also head technology and web development in which capacity I've spearheaded the expansion 
    of our online presence and oversaw development of our websites and online tools. You can read more

<p>In October of 2017, I began exploring a career switch to web development with a special interest in 
    civic tech. I enrolled in a night course at First Step Coding, an 8-week introduction to JavaScript 
    fundamentals. While at First Step, I became increasingly confident in my ability to successfully 
    transition into this new career, and in January of 2018, I left Nonprofit VOTE and pursue re-training 
    full-time.</p>
