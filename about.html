<p>I spent the last twelve and a half years working for Nonprofit VOTE, a a 501(c)(3) that works with nonprofit service providers and community-based organizations to help the people they serve become active participants in our democracy. As Director Research and Training I created new training materials and other resources to assist nonprofit in integrating civic and voter engagement into their ongoing services.

</p><p>While at Nonprofit VOTE, I was also head technology and web development in which capacity I've spearheaded the expansion of our online presence and oversaw development of our websites and online tools.

</p><p>In October of 2017, I began exploring a career switch to web development with a special interest in 
    civic tech. I enrolled in a night course at First Step Coding, an 8-week introduction to JavaScript 
    fundamentals. While at First Step, I became increasingly confident in my ability to successfully 
    transition into this new career, and in January of 2018, I left Nonprofit VOTE and pursue re-training 
    full-time.</p>
