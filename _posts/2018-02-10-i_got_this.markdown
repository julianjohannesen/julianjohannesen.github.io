I enrolled at [FlatIron School](http://flatironschool.com) today. If you’ve never heard of it, FlatIron is one of the most successful operations in the code bootcamp industry. Over 800 hours, FlatIron attempts to prepare students for a junior position in web development. Enrolling at FlatIron is a big step for me. It’s a major milestone in my transition into this new career.

Switching careers at age 46 is scary. It’s scary, right? I should be scared. I mean, I just left my job of 12 years - a job I loved at a nonprofit doing absolutely amazing work - to embark on a new career in a field about which I know very little. What if things don’t work out? How will I pay my mortgage? And I'm 46.  That's old! Can my brain even handle learning a skill like computer programming? 

But I’m not scared. Not really. There’s not a doubt in my mind that I will be successful in this adventure. If I were you and I had just read the last line, I’d be thinking, “Well, la-di-da, Mr. Confident. It must be nice being you.” I want you to know that I’m not the type of person who often writes things like “There’s not a doubt in my mind that I will be successful.” It feels weird. 

That confidence is the result of a lot of research and preparation. If you’ve seen an article floating around Medium about switching careers, or about attending a coding bootcamp, or job prospects for bootcamp graduates versus computer science graduates (that’s a popular one), well, I’ve probably seen it too. I’ve spoken to bootcamp graduates, bootcamp instructors, bootcamp recruiters, friends who are self-taught and who worked their way up in web development, and just about anyone else who will stand still long enough for me to ask them a question or two about any of the above. I’ve spent hours poring over [SwitchUp.org](http://switchup.org) and [CourseReport.com](http://coursereport.com).

Most importantly, I attended an absolutely fantastic bootcamp prep program at [First Step Coding](http://firststepcoding.com). Over 8 weeks at FSC I dug into real, albeit fairly simple, programming challenges. I used my first nested for loop. I wrote my first function. By the time I graduated, I’d used The Movie Database’s API to create an application to display the top grossing movies in any given year by genre. And most importantly, I learned that I loved doing those things. 

That I loved coding didn’t come as complete surprise to me. I've been interested in the internet since the 80's. I remember how absolutely awestruck I was by [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), when I first heard about them in 1985. The first MUD appeared in '78, but I was bit behind the curve. I remember thinking, "You mean to tell me that hundreds of people from all over the world can play a game in a virtual world of their own making, all in real time? I'm living in the future!" Pretty geeky. I was completely swept up in the internet euphoria of the 90's. That feeling of awe and optimism about the “information age” has never waned. 

In 2006, soon after I’d started at the job I just left, I used WordPress version 2.0 to create the company’s first website. I was so excited by the possibilities in WordPress that I ended up spending nights and weekends reading the documentation and fiddling with the site. As the company grew, my responsibilities shifted away from that work, but I remained an avid hobbyist for years, before drifting away from web development.

So, I’ve come by confidence honestly. It’s been a long time in the making.

I can’t tell you how excited I am to be a student at FlatIron School. Onward and upward!
